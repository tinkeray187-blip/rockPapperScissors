1) First create 
    *- github repo
    *- .html file
    *- link it to .js file
    *- check it with console.log(Rock, Paper, Sissors)

2) Start with logic for function(getComputerChoice)
    *- getComputerChoice needs to RANDOMLY <return>
      "rock", "paper", or "Sissors"
    *- using Math.random method
    *- test with console.log()

3) Then write logic for getHumanChoice
    *- create function getHumanChoice
    *- getHumanChoice needs to return the valid 
      choice of the user input
    *- use <prompt> method to get the users input
    *- test with console.log

4) Keep track of players score variables 
    *- create two variables <humanScore> and 
      <computerScore>
    *- initialize them with a value of 0

5) Write logic to play a single round
    *- create function <playRound>
    *- define two parameters for <playRound>
      -<humanChoise>
      -<computerChoice>
    *- make <humanChoice> case-insensitive
    *- write code for <playRound> function to 
      console.log("winner", or "loser") to 
      represent round winner
    *- increment <humanScore> or <computerScore>
      based on round winner

6) Write logic to play 5 round game
    - create function <playGame> that calls
      <playRound> for 5 rounds and keeps track 
      of score and declares winner
    - move <playRound> function and score variables
      INSIDE of <playGame> function
    - play 5 rounds by calling <playRound> 5 times
